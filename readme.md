Working in engineering leadership and management is a different world than being an engineer. Whether you're in it already or looking to transition these resources can be helpful. There's a wealth of knowledge out there and I'm happy to lift up others content. A variety of different content types are listed including some technical resources such as systems design or cloud cerifications.

Plenty of these are valuable for roles other than tech too!

This is the first version so it will be less organized and detailed. You can find the source on my website repo but a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dandigangi/engineering-manager-resources">dedicated repo can be found here</a>. If future updates I'll make specific recommendations and ranking. I cannot vouch for the quality of all of these resources. (<small>**LAST UPDATED**: 1/30/24</small>)

This was inspired by my friend <a href="https://github.com/ryanburgess/engineer-manager">Ryan Burgess's list</a>. I'm sure there will be crossover but I swear it wasn't stolen. üòù Make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/burgessdryan" target="_blank">follow him on Twitter</a>. Super grateful for all his support.

## Certifications

This last one isn't something that has ever been asked of me nor do I look for it when hiring but it can add value. Cloud/infrastructure certifications hold more value IMHO since you need to understand systems at many levels to build them effectively with your team.

- [AWS Certifications](https://aws.amazon.com/certification)
- [Azure Certifications](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/training-and-certifications)
- [GCP Certifications](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification)
- [IEEE Computer Society: Professional Engineering Manager Certification](https://www.computer.org/product/education/professional-software-engineering-master-certification)

#### Something missing or low quality in my list? [Let me know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dandigangi).

p.s. Don't let anyone tell you management or engineering is harder. They are different roles with unique and overlapping
challenges.
